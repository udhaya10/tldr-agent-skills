Quickstart

Copy page

This tutorial shows you how to use Agent Skills to create a PowerPoint presentation. You'll learn how to enable Skills, make a simple request, and access the generated file.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude API key](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys)
- Python 3.7+ or curl installed
- Basic familiarity with making API requests

## Agent Skills overview

Pre-built Agent Skills extend Claude's capabilities with specialized expertise for tasks like creating documents, analyzing data, and processing files. Anthropic provides the following pre-built Agent Skills in the API:

- **PowerPoint (pptx):** Create and edit presentations
- **Excel (xlsx):** Create and analyze spreadsheets
- **Word (docx):** Create and edit documents
- **PDF (pdf):** Generate PDF documents

**Want to create custom Skills?** See the [Agent Skills Cookbook](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/skills-notebooks-01-skills-introduction) for examples of building your own Skills with domain-specific expertise.

## Step 1: List available Skills

First, check what Skills are available. Use the Skills API to list all Anthropic-managed Skills:

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
# List Anthropic-managed Skills
ant beta:skills list --source anthropic
```

You see the following Skills: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, and `pdf`.

This API returns each Skill's metadata: its name and description. Claude loads this metadata at startup to know what Skills are available. This is the first level of **progressive disclosure**, where Claude discovers Skills without loading their full instructions yet.

## Step 2: Create a presentation

Now use the PowerPoint Skill to create a presentation about renewable energy. Specify Skills using the `container` parameter in the Messages API:

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
# Create a message with the PowerPoint Skill
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    max_tokens=16000,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "skills": [{"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "pptx", "version": "latest"}]
    },
    messages=[\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides",\
        }\
    ],
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}],
)

print(f"stop_reason={response.stop_reason}, blocks={len(response.content)}")
```

Let's break down what each part does:

- **`container.skills`:** Specifies which Skills Claude can use
- **`type: "anthropic"`:** Indicates this is an Anthropic-managed Skill
- **`skill_id: "pptx"`:** The PowerPoint Skill identifier
- **`version: "latest"`:** The Skill version set to the most recently published
- **`tools`:** Enables code execution (required for Skills)
- **Beta headers:**`code-execution-2025-08-25` and `skills-2025-10-02`

When you make this request, Claude automatically matches your task to the relevant Skill. Since you asked for a presentation, Claude determines the PowerPoint Skill is relevant and loads its full instructions: the second level of progressive disclosure. Then Claude executes the Skill's code to create your presentation.

## Step 3: Download the created file

The presentation was created in the code execution container and saved as a file. The response includes a file reference with a file ID. Extract the file ID and download it using the Files API:

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
# Extract file ID from the code-execution tool result. The Skill might run
# its work through either the Python or bash code-execution tool, so check
# both result types.
file_id = None
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == "code_execution_tool_result":
        if block.content.type == "code_execution_result":
            for output in block.content.content:
                file_id = output.file_id
    elif block.type == "bash_code_execution_tool_result":
        if block.content.type == "bash_code_execution_result":
            for output in block.content.content:
                file_id = output.file_id

if file_id:
    # Download the file and save it
    output_path = Path(tempfile.gettempdir()) / "renewable_energy.pptx"
    file_content = client.beta.files.download(file_id=file_id)
    file_content.write_to_file(output_path)
    print(f"Presentation saved to {output_path}")
```

For complete details on working with generated files, see the [code execution tool documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#retrieve-generated-files).

## Try more examples

Now that you've created your first document with Skills, try these variations:

### Create a spreadsheet

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    max_tokens=16000,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "skills": [{"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "xlsx", "version": "latest"}]
    },
    messages=[\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Create a quarterly sales tracking spreadsheet with sample data",\
        }\
    ],
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}],

        }\
    ],
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20250825", "name": "code_execution"}],
