# Command: `tldr api-check`

## Ground Truth (`tldr api-check --help`)
```text
Detect API misuse patterns (missing timeouts, bare except, weak crypto, unclosed files)

Usage: tldr api-check [OPTIONS] <path>

Arguments:
  <path>
          File or directory to analyze (path to file or directory)

Options:
      --category <CATEGORY>
          Filter by misuse category
          
          [possible values: call-order, error-handling, parameters, resources, crypto, concurrency, security]

      --severity <SEVERITY>
          Filter by minimum severity
          
          [possible values: info, low, medium, high]

          Output file (optional, stdout if not specified)

          Supported by every command: json, text, compact.
          
          Command-specific formats (rejected at runtime by other commands): sarif  — only: vuln, clones dot    — only: calls, impact, hubs, inheritance, clones, deps
          
          cli-error-clarity-v2 (P2.BUG-5): possible values are hidden on the global help to avoid promising sarif/dot for every subcommand. Run `tldr <cmd> --help` to confirm what a specific command emits, and see `validate_format_for_command` in `output.rs` for the source of truth.
          
          [default: json]

  -l, --lang <LANG>
          Programming language (auto-detect if not specified)
