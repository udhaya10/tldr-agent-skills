# Command: `tldr contracts`

## Ground Truth (`tldr contracts --help`)
```text
Infer pre/postconditions from guard clauses, assertions, isinstance checks

Usage: tldr contracts [OPTIONS] <FILE> <FUNCTION>

Arguments:
  <FILE>
          Source file to analyze

  <FUNCTION>
          Function name to analyze

Options:
  -l, --lang <LANG>
          Programming language (auto-detected from file extension if not specified)

          Supported by every command: json, text, compact.
          
          Command-specific formats (rejected at runtime by other commands): sarif  — only: vuln, clones dot    — only: calls, impact, hubs, inheritance, clones, deps
          
          cli-error-clarity-v2 (P2.BUG-5): possible values are hidden on the global help to avoid promising sarif/dot for every subcommand. Run `tldr <cmd> --help` to confirm what a specific command emits, and see `validate_format_for_command` in `output.rs` for the source of truth.
